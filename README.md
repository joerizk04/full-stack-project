# My Full Stack Website

**Student Name:** 
Joe Rizk

**API Used:** 
API Ninjas Exercises API 
https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises

**Project Description:** 
The website created is a gym website (The Circuit). It consists of 7 pages (signup - login - home - programs - store - about - contact). The navigation between these pages relies on a collapsable and stylish sidebar, or using quick links in the footer. Both the sidebar and the footer are present and accessible in all the pages. I created a databse using MySQL and connected it to the website for a real signup and login simulation. The website let the logged in users to access some workout programs based on the sport category chosen (bodybuilding or calisthenics), the exercises description, level and eqipment used, are fetched by API Ninjas using the name of the exercise as key and can be displayed for the user on demand. The store page has a search bar and category dropdown to let the shopping be more flexible. In addition a cart system is implemented showing the items chosen and the total amount. The contact page contains contact information about 'The Circuit' gym and message form to access users reviews. These reviews or messages will be collected in a text document with all the information entered.

**Custom UI Requirement:** 
I am required to implement a timeline-style section using Flexbox or Grid. For this reason, the about page is created in a timeline manner, indicating the gym s evolution and milestones from the date it was founded until the last upgrade or milestone.
