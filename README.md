**Project Description:** 
The website created is a gym website called "The Circuit". It consists of 7 pages (signup - login - home - programs - store - about - contact). The navigation between these pages relies on a collapsible and stylish sidebar, or using quick links in the footer. Both the sidebar and the footer are present and accessible in all the pages. I created a database using MySQL and connected it to the website for a real signup and login simulation. The website let the logged in users to access some workout programs based on the sport category chosen: "bodybuilding" or "calisthenics". The exercises description, level and equipment used are fetched by API Ninjas using the name of the exercise as key. These exercises details can be displayed or hidden for the user delivering a smooth interaction between the client and the server. The store page includes a search bar and a category dropdown to let the shopping process be more flexible. In addition a cart system is implemented showing the items selected and the total amount. The contact page contains contact information about 'The Circuit' gym and a message form to review users complaints. These reviews or messages will be collected in a text document with all the information entered. Since i am required to create a timeline section, the about page is created in an attractive timeline way to show a chronological sequence of events related to the gym.

**Custom UI Requirement:** 
I am required to implement a timeline-style section using Flexbox or Grid. For this reason, the about page is created in a timeline manner, indicating the gym s evolution and milestones from the date it was founded until the last upgrade or milestone. Using flexbox it was not very hard to align the events on the right and left sides of a vertical time line having an absolute position. Flexend and flexstart content justifying are used to distribute the timeline containers or milestones in a timeline style.
